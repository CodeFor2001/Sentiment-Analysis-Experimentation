i come from an india where comedians talk reality and politicians do comedy 
people loving this and people hating this just proves the whole damn point of  two indias 
i come from an india   where every one needs a change   and no one leads a change   
that india that you are proud of is also proud of you for spitting facts despite knowing that these    year old leaders and their followers are gonna pounce on you the moment this video hits the web  kudos to you 
as music starts  everything you said keeps running in mind and as it ends  ask which india we  want     
i come from an india where we fight hard for the justice of a celebrity and yet i come from an india where crores of cases are pending 
i come from an india where   log kya kahenge  has more value than one s feelings and emotions  
i haven t seen anyone who have that much courage to speak truth 
i have always loved you idk why but yes and each and every word is true i m really proud of you for being so courageous  
ideas that were considered false at one point by the entire society and  therefore  suppressed turned out to be true later on  a society that completely suppresses all the ideas that are not acceptable today  runs the danger of losing the benefits of what might turn out to be very valuable knowledge  
 i come from an india which idolizes northeastern athletes when they win medals  but calls them chinese at any moment of time 
i come from an india where elections can do everything and protests can do nothing 
well  if you want to whoop our s in your grounds  you have to start playing with us first and that other india won t never let that happen  nice monologue bro  it s also true for pakistan as well 
you ve said what my dad says everyday reading the newspaper  be as brave as you are creative man  say what needs to be said  always
all indians each and everyone are responsible for the status of india  its we who can elevate it    
people are angry that why this poem was  recited outside india  logically speaking only going outside india   you can say that  i come from from an india        
the only controversial thing he said about india is that  he told the truth  and leaders are unhappy about it 
people who are saying that he should have addressed these issues in our country and not in front of the world  have finally recognized that these things are the issues  issues which were not considered an issue before           
every joke has a deep down pain  he talked about the pain directly  depending upon how you say it  you feel as a laugh or sorrow
people taking sides on vir s two indias just proves that there are two indias
 no one is hated more than he who speaks the truth    plato
i would attend my school and college everyday if he was my social teacherplot twist   repeal of   farm law s
we are proud of u mr vir das    this was the hard truth and you had the guts to say it  with over   lakh likes   everyone gets it as well  
i can t stop my tears  i had to constantly wipe my tears to watch it till the end    it s soul shaking  vir das thank you for this feeling  it was worth it  every single word you spoke 
i believe what he said was all true  but still as he says we live in india where we listen to    year old  keep doing it vir das i stand for you  lots of love and suppoto you 
 the further a society drifts from the truth  the more it will hate those that speak it    george orwell
the path of righteousness is brutal and not everyone can walk on it
omg he is so right  then why so much controversy   people r really that much dumb nowadays   shitty people busy in making controversy for something which is bitter truth   basically we indians nowadays cant handle the truth as it is always bitter   idiocy at its best  bravo veer das really proud of u and ur fearless soul      
i dunno man  this just gives me chills 
vir das  this is one of the best monologue  i have heard in recent years   
 this whole thing is a gigantic joke   it s just that it isn t funny   i am speechless 
this is intelligent  comedy   and as he rightly said  not a joke     mins of eloquence  hard hitting truth and love for the country  heady combination 
well said brother  i just read an article in  the hindu  over the controversy created by ur  two indias   everything u said is truth  u might have seen two indias  rxns over this video too
 who wants laughs when you can laugh all the way to you know where  why make up a joke when you can make serious money by fooling around facts  facts  that s why it hurts all the more  being a proud indian  dil se bura lagta hai bhai  
i am from the green and i will say that even though we are at odds with the blue  i am proud that they still have a couple of people with the balls to say the truth unlike us i hope we can have people like that too
bitterest and the most original truth that any indian could hear 
i come from an india where people like me cannot stop themselves from clapping even after two minutes the show ended   i belong to both of the indias and i m proud of one  
hats off to u for being bold enough to tell the entire truth about our country right now in theae few minutes
long years later  when this is all just a recorded instance in history  the few  but the significant few will continue to recite this inwardly as they come to grips with the india that has triumphed  
 desis send money to ensure the traditions are preserved and prosper back home  they also spend on indian artists coming to america to entertain them  vir das wrote a poem  no jokes  words too real to laugh at  too surreal to make sense of  this guy has lost it  
 to other countries  i may go as a tourist   but to india   i come as a pilgrim     sir martin luther king  jr 
we are proud of you  thank you  i hope people become courageous like you and see the real india   fight for its problems  although bhakts will never see any problem because  ram rajya hai bharat mein  
sir what you said is soo true  every single word has it s own meaning i hads off    to you sir that you may have that much courage to speak because some people are just a puppet of the    yrs old mentality thank you sir showing us two india   
this is a masterpiece  
well said broreally appreciate it  
 i come from a india that wears it s heart on its sleeve and  i come from india that never looses hope  
thankyou for bringing out our problems which noone is willing to or has the courage to talk about    ik you will suffer a lot of hate but we got your back 
i came here after the controversy  at first my thoughts were  why is he saying bad things about india on international level  but after watching the video and thinking about it for a moment  i do agree with veer das in his comment 
i come from an india that embraces it s freedom but i also come from an india where the ones who speak their mind or point out the country s shortcomings are oppressed harder than anyone else
proud of you vir    what you did took a lot of guts    
i come from an india where criticism is considered as part of liberty in our country but when you criticise you become a triator and when you bootlick or praise you consider as nationalist   
well spoken        agree there should be freedom of speech and we should be able to freely highlight our problems and not hide them from the world  only then can we become aware of them and start to work together on solutions  i do agree that we need to innovate and incorporate some ideas from the west and the youth and let go of some out dated idea  however i feel at the same time the poem could have been a bit more balanced and talk to bit more about our rich history and culture and our religion which is the oldest in the world  i felt also he disregarded the wisdom of elders and our traditions  end of the day i feel we should be comfortable in having more open discussions about politics in our culture rather than suppressing this important dialogue for the progress of our nation 
well explained india by  vir das   we re indian so we can t hide of our current situations   realities 
full sumpport   you raised many critical issues of india which media doesn t
excelleny  a masterpiece   
i live in india  where comedian s do politics  and politician s do comedy 
in just a short video you have explained a long journey of those indian who are suffering everyday for a proper meal  for education of their child and many things in their day today life and people who are running the nation are busy in fulfilling their own wishes and privatizating everything which are made for the ease of common man  i really support you because nobody has that much of courage to say these things in public and raise voice for these people  you have set an example for many people because nobody has that much of courage to go against those who running the nation  keep it up we have proud on       
well said and so true   stay strong and keep the faith 
this is beautiful vir das 
i come from india where every celebrity wants controversy to get attention but no one has courage to speak about real problems in india  thank you vir das  we indians  needs a reality check  first we should acknowledge our problems so we would work on them  we need this poem    
i come from india where getting into iit is the greatest achievement of indian and yet iit is the dramatic example of brain drain  in which majority of iitians never came back to make india powerful and better 
what this guy said is actually correct  especially the part of blue green and orange   
i get his point he just pointed on the problems to create betterment in our country      cause in this globalised world they already know these problems but it was only done to create some pressure and betterment in our society
george carlin would be nodding approvingly in his own carlin way 
i came to watch this video after knowing about the  controversy       i came with a mindset to hate this content     but when i watched     i really loved it      then i came to comment section with a mindset that people must be hating it and i will be only one to praise it    but here i didn t find a single hate comment     then who is creating the controversy      i think people from the another india 
this political sattire is so massively instrumental and poetic that for a while i felt like giving a standing ovation right after vir finished his poem 
your courage is just next level   
waooo    what a masterpiece
isn t its a fact    everything having two sides    everything means everything    well said vir  
that was amazing   keep it on bro   proud of u   being an indian         
i come from an india where a joke is taken very seriously  while serious issues are taken as a joke  
yes you reveal the reality of india bro   we appreciate you 
explains why so many are upset with this video    truth is a hard pill to swallow 
well now what veer started is a movement of sort  hope he knows he comes from india who is proud of him for this  
fun fact  his remarks on two india is causing more traffic on his channel and particularly on this video    
i come from an india where gaumutra is sacred and a human is untouchable   
if you want to correct a problem learn to acknowledge it first  bravo vir 
my addition to vir das  amazing recital  i come from two indias   i come from two indiasi come from an india that worships cows  and yet we are one of the largest exporters of beef in the world  how  
love it very bold of you  the number of likes here shows the support from the viewers  keep it up  waiting for more in the days ahead
i come from an india where stand up comedians work as journalists and i also come from an india where journalists work as stand up comedians
i come from an india which produces some of the greatest coders and software developers yet many people consider html and css as programming languages     d  d
was here for the controversy but leaving with a massive truth and you know  the sad part is  i from a india that knows all about it but just doesn t seem to f   care to do anything about it  
the perfect poem  comedy and reality    
good on you vir   i am sick of people acting patriot without admitting the dark side of the nation   what you said is pretty much illustrated the true character of sub continent and it s people  god bless and love from bangladesh
our songs are  boht hard but our sentiments are boht soft  now our country made it real 
he s just so good      
if this was done in india  he would be charged sedition and uapa
i come from pakistan    but this is some next level indian who i hope gets back to his two indias    safely     i would have applauded louder than all the people in that house if i were there  and i m applauding louder than my neighbours could hear from where i m watching this right now         
thank you vir das  all of this applies to pakistan too 
i come from both the india s and still proud of my country  there will be a time where there will be one good india 
the goosebump in the end was real    
am gonna forward this in my extended family group 
i do believe what vir said is absolutely true 
the comment section is a mixed bag   haters as well as lovers   that proves the point of two indias   
we live in an india where people support george floyd but appoints a fair skin lady  at the office reception 
i am so glad that i subscribed to this guy some years ago  and saw this original video first before some indian news channel talk shit about it  hats off to you man  it s not an insult of india  its reality and truth is always bitter but for those who don t understand and love india blindly 
this is exactly perfect
your each and every lines touch the reality  hats of you brother    but after all we still say yes we are indian we can change n we can make incritabl india  
this video will haunt it cell guys for a long time to come   
 if you are offended by this you know which india you are from    very well said
i come from an india where we all talk about  unity in diversity   but no one knows the meaning of unity 
i come from an india where leaders are playing with the life of youngster and through them into fire 
you said it man  i m proud of you  
the i come from an india where people like me cannot stop themselves from clapping even after two minutes the show ended   i belong to both of the indias and i m proud of one  
i come from an india where  teenagers dream and talk about developing the country whereas politicians gossip and comment on one another like teenagers  
    k likes against   k dislikes   clearly shows two india and also showes which india is stronger   god bless india   jay hind   
i am listening to this poem for the third or fourth time now and i have goosebumps every time i listen to it  this is truly a masterpiece  lots of respect to u for speaking the truth out loud   
finally someone speaking our hearts   respect
i come from an india where comedians talk about real issue and politicians do comedy 
salute to him  i wish all these issues were discussed by media and youth gets courage to ask goverment about what they had and suposed to do 
the bitter truth  well said vir    
the india  we are proud of  is winning atleast in youtube likes  kudos vir and congratulations 
totally agree with every point   only small  narrow   sanghi minds will take offence   shame  that comediens are hounded and even courts treat them unfairly  when they are speaking issues where the majority are fearful to speak under a ruling fascist mentality in power 
i have never seen your videos before but one thing i want to say that whatever you have said is reallity of india in present time  log sab kuch janty hain but bolty ni kyunki agar aap sawal karty hain to aap deshdrohi hain  there is nothing to hate in this video  all the propgenda is created by the people for just some publicity  and to you vir i haven t seen anyone who have that much courage to speak truth  keep it up come what may  
i really agree on this  mainly couples fall in love stays together in live in  relationship but due to cast they can t marry  this is india   people should be seen as human first   why is there boundaries 
the fact is about two india in one country  you raised your voice its respectable  but what are you doing about it  a few years ago most people tried and failed some got ignored  and now how will virdas gonna do it 
i am from an india where a political party i can t say anything beyond i always looked like this as if someone has committed a crime  and without do anything great praising our support  you get padamshri  i really like this virdas great work 
just came here to know what actually the controversy is   but i find the truth  pmcares
too good   heart wrenching  
 there is a gigantic joke   but it just isn t funny  line was so introspective    sochne pe mazboor kar kar  degi
    yes  indeed  good one vir 
proud of you man i hope we can resolve issues together     
from singur west bengal     i love you bro  for saying truth     
what a fabulous job by vir das  he s more veer than no veer savarkar   
the fact that he already knew this is gonna burn so many people back home is just sad  freedom of speech is literally dying in our country  yet  i do not find anything wrong with what vir das has said  we need to start acknowledging that we have flaws before we can be any better  and yes  i believe in that great india and i always will  great poetry 
i really liked this video back then   days ago and still doi just came back after hearing that people making controversy out of it i knew how f ked our media is   but how can people be soooo  annoyingly stupid
whatever he said is absolutely right  instead of hating him for  telling the truth we should try to resolve all the problems 
i come from an india where people are judged on the basis that how well they know the language of another country  but i come from an india where people are proud to speak their own mother tongue and use it to read and write    generally and literary wise    
hearing this  i realise  he was aware of the massive outrage this would cause  but he chose that stage because he knew this poem will also go down in history as something which will be quoted time and again for all the wrong and right reasons 
simply aswm   their is nothing to offend on this   this is our harsh reality 
i am proud of the fact that you spoke and you spoke the truth and reality and yet you believe in the future of india  india is what we make it  let us not fall back to deary dead habit as tagore said   let this country awake  we indians are more than proud of you   
 this whole thing is a gigantic joke   it s just that it isn t funny  
all the people were focusing on one sentence because of that they are missing such a beautifui poem
he is spitting facts  i came here to see him disrespecting people but bro is straight up spitting facts 
youtube  removes the dislike countpoliticians  now  how do we show our hate towards comedy and our love for money 
i have listend it more than    times
we have to accept it    whatever he spoke    was absolutely true     yeah it s harsh and hard to digest but    it s true    it s our responsibility to make the one india    what we want to see in india    so let s change whatever we don t like and by things we feel ashamed of ourselves    
gotta say  this wasn t as bad as i thought it would be  he s got good comedic timing and creativity and stuff  but a few things here and there were super unnecessary especially for a stand up  i don t really get why he was arrested but eh i guess he got the clout and fame he wanted it in the end  while we outrage and shit  this dude s making good fucking money  look at the number of people in the audience holy shit 
this man made a mark   well done vir  
 i come from an india which never shuts up and which doesn t speak up   so true   
i would like to see an india where there is no discrimination and everybody feels we are all same
brother you have done which most of us wont   showing the reality to the world take courage   you are brave   we as indian are proud of you
tryst with destiny long years ago we made a tryst with destiny  and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge  not wholly or in full measure  but very substantially  at the stroke of the midnight hour  when the world sleeps  india will awake to life and freedom  a moment comes  which comes but rarely in history  when we step out from the old to new  when an age ends  and when the soul of a nation  long suppressed  finds utterance   
not a single word he said i could deny for  this man deserves all accolades he is receiving    
 to learn who rules over you  simply find out who you re not allowed to criticize  voltaire 
that s so true       this is the harsh reality of india today      
i come from an india where we suppose to be a wise voter rather than a political party worker 
 since free speech has reasonable restrictions on india so this coward vir das goes to america to say horrible things about india  there s a difference between speaking truth and speaking truth to power  
whoever read this   please take it positively  dear vir dass  please add this also in your comedy  
 there is a gigantic joke in this standup comedy but it isn t funny   very well said and i don t think we will ever take this joke seriously tooo
when u get a chance to speak up in foreign in front of foreign audience then be a  vivekanand not a  virdas
i don t get why some people are so offended by everything he said in this video it s all truth 
the truths  i salute you sir   
vir das talked about multiple things current issues  including faults in the system govt like high petrol prices or no information on pm cares fund  murder of farmers etc  the people  mostly politicians or associated with bjp  who said vir das insulted country in the west were just trying to find a reason to not mention that he spoke the truth about the govt and had to come up with some random things to defame him  like  he insulted  not the govt or the system but  the whole country and in front of americans although the poem was really beautiful and made me love india more  maybe soon they will add some hindu and anti hindu elements as well to this news just to create a feeling of hatred towards him in the common people  they are just scared of the applause and the masses getting to know about the dark truths and agreeing with him  if there was a smaller audience or it no one applauded on vir das s speech then they wouldn t care so much because what he said was not something people are unaware of  defaming people who speak anything that can make people to doubt their govt is very important for the govt once the person is defamed his voice is no more a legit voice it is just some anti national uttering nonsense 
one can listen to this over and over again  it speaks of the pain we all have been carrying in our hearts but are too timid to voice it ourselves  we turn blind eye to our fellow countrymen being brutalized  we stay silent when our freedom struggle is discredited  we keep shut when we see bodies floating down rivers  so when this man comes along and speaks what we have been trying so hard to suppress  the floodgates of emotions just open  and all that was suppressed is let lose  we love you vir das  history will look back upon you with kind eyes 
your each word explains how much you love and  want to get back that india which we all want    salute  
this      minute video should be played in parliament   all state assemblies so that our uneducated politicians know about some real issues and use their peanut size brain to solve them 
       no one laughed everyone was shocked shame on you vir das
where speaking the truth is a sin  and sinning is a virtue
the last applause give goosebumps  thank you very much for this great monologue and reminding all indians that we need to make india great again   
is it just me or someone did really say  shut up  in the background at       
the sincerity of words   
i come from india where we are studying hard for entrance and i come from india where high tech institution are less in number 
i came here after dhruv rathee s video   this poem is wonderful to hear again and again but for some people it s hard to digest the reality 
the moment when all religions see up and think price of petrol made me        
i come from an india where people are cared for and loved always and so castigators like mr vir das is always forgiven 
one day we would also like to know how you were conceived by your parents  that would be fun to hear  what do you say                d
what a masterpiece    damnnnnn       you are doing great work     and for doing great work it need a courage and balls of steel               
well put but caste based violence is definitely missing 
the current controversy around this monologue proves vir das s entire point
    true        
i come from an india where comedians do criticism  and opposition leader do comedy btw loved every sentence    
hats of bro    keepp gng   your poetry is true but the presentation was awesome on another level    truly amazing   the work you done which is priceless       support you    from my heart  
proud of you brother love your thoughts
i listened every word he said with utmost care and i find its very carefully written poem  every word with accurate balance of feelings which every indian wants to talk about  not just that i wasn t aware about any man name  vir das and now i know he s such an humble gentleman 
i came from the india where all the great freedom fighters lives in our heart ane i came from india where ram    is a god and i am proud to be a indian the one india

so true and beautiful   nice composition  lot of respect and big salute to you  wow
vir das i cannot tell you how much i love  respect and admire you for speaking the truth  the whole truth  and nothing but the truth   
i come from an india where actresses educate us on history  history graduates act as economists and the actual economists are redundant because who wants to listen  
i am coming from india where   election  has the power to change the law  
i come from an india where  i would have appreciated this only if u would have said all this in india    please stop telling others abt the darker side of india  ps  i m nt telling u to stop saying abt darker side but jst keep in mind where u r saying all this      
i came to watch this vdo after listening so many things on media   but guess what   i ended up liking the script 
i come from an india which was once capable of understanding and explaining the whole creation universes and today i come from india where its own sons are ruining that great culture                         but again i feel it s oki because it s already written there in vedas n  matter how much you try to bring man on good path he won t follow sanatana rules of existence because this is kalyug my dear            mental awareness of human existence is totally lost in material world
the  india  vir das is proud of  is proud of vir das 
in india the real jokers are seating in parliament   and audiences are fighting for thier jokers on social media  
whatever he said that is reality
just truth 
i came from two india where everyone wants equality but none of them want to loose their reservation and minority status
our ruling party is cracking down upon satirist  there was a story by hindi satirist parsai  he wrote a story showing how ineffective and slow our government offices are  the story was in our school textbook  then the government thought  the story is against the sense of pride  so they removed the story from our textbook  
when comedian realizes the truth 
wow     i never new he was so talented    
you forgot to take a bow sir  this masterpiece deserves one  take a bow                            
i come from an india where people talk about dowry to take on their son s wedding and i come from an india where father is looking for a groom for his daughter who is rich  government employee or who is taking a salary in lacs from private firm 
children s living in basement have more courage than man s living in skykrepars  reality of bollywood and cricketer s 
only one word came to mind throughout the video  wow  powerful  strong and to the point  
we appreciate what you have spoken in kennedy center  
they all kept clapping       for more than    sec    isn t that amazing   
i come from an india that is going to watch this and say this isn t stand up comedy  where is the goddamn joke  and yet i come from an india that will watch this and know there is a gigantic joke   it isn t just funny

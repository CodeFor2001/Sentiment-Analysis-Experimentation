# Sentiment-Analysis-Experimentation
This is just a personal experiment, where i am trying to Use various methods of performing sentiment analysis. I'm trying to use the famous libraries and their low level functions. The dataset consists of extracted "Top Comments" of a youtube video.

The dataset uploaded has around 199 comments i scraped, the notebook has the code for scraping too
Till now i have tried:
- TextBlob (on cleaned data)
- NRClex (on cleaned data)
- VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyser (on cleaned & uncleaned data) (My favorite one so far)

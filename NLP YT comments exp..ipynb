Maybe soon they will add some Hindu and anti-Hindu elements as well to this news just to create a feeling of hatred towards him in the common people. They are just scared of the applause and the masses getting to know about the dark truths and agreeing with him, if there was a smaller audience or it no one applauded on vir das's speech then they wouldn't care so much because what he said was not something people are unaware of.
